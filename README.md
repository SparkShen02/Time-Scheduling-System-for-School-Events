# Time Scheduling System for School Events
A web-based scheduling system that helps teachers gather and summarize students' opinions about the appropriate time-slot for certain events.

This was my first Web Development project and was developed during high school. 

## General Information

### Motivation
My motivation for developing the scheduling system stemmed from a phenomenon at school - it was incredibly inconvenient for teachers to arrange an event or a test. What they commonly did was asking class by class, which was both time-consuming and ineffective since different students had different opinions, making it hard for the teacher to determine the best time-slot for most students. Therefore, I decided to design an online system to help teachers gather and summarize opinions about what time-slot should one certain event take place.

### Languages and Tools
To complete the system, I studied HTML, MySQL, and PHP on my own. I created the layout and contents on webpages with HTML, created a MySQL database where information about the events and votes of the students will be stored in, and used PHP to receive and send data between both the 
webpages and the database.

### Outcome
In the final product, teachers only need to give essential information about the event - name, date, and duration - and ask students to access the webpage to vote for the time-slot they preferred. Then, teachers would get a list of time-slots ranked from the most chosen to the least. The system is convenient to use, with clear guidelines explaining what action is needed from the user.

### Future Improvements
In the future, I hope to apply Machine Learning to allow the system to automatically recommend a time-slot based on previous data about similar events.

## Paper
I wrote a paper that summarizes everything I did for this project. It has detailed descriptions of my development process and testing process. It also introduces and explains every feature of the system, with screenshots of some source codes and displays of the final webpages.
